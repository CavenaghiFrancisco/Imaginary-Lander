*Cheerful humming*
Mom: Babe, put your toys away. Listen kiddo, if you don´t put your toys away; I´m gonna to donate them.
Oh nooo, I forgot to hide my favorite rocket. I have to focus. Maybe if I imagine the perfect place to hide it, mama won´t find it.
*Mental effort*
Mmm no, this place is too visible. I must find another one.
Mom: Hurry up lady, dinner is almost done.
I can´t leave my favorite toy on the bed, I might break it if i´m not carefull.
Mom: Dinner is on the table.
Just a second.
Mmm the shelves are a good spot, but I must find one that is higher.
I can´t leave it here, it might get dirty and mama won´t like that.
Mom: For God´s sake, come on. Food is getting cold.
Yes! This place is perfect!
Now I must take it there myself.
Wait... Where is my rocket?
Mom: Last call kiddo! If you don´t come right now, you are getting time out.
Ok... ok... I´m going mama.
*Door opening and closing*
